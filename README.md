##What is this
This repository is meant to be an open source archive for the original `Heichal Negina`'s translations and, hopefully, its translated recordings.

This repository has been created so that everyone, including non-yiddish speakers could learn and enjoy the rich Chabad nigunim (melodies).

Any contribution will be much appreciated.
